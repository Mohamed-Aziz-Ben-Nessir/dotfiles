Hello there! and welcome to my collection of rices!<br>
I try to keep my designs as minimal and responsive as possible (I don't mind a lot of keybinds) and I usually prefer dark themes.<br>
I also try to keep them as optimized as possible for max possible speed.
feel free to take and use what ever you like, hope you enjoy!
